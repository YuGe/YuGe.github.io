Both [Octopress][] and [Harmony][] are [Jekyll][] based framework for blogging. I
used [Octopress][] for about half a year, and wrote several blogs. Now, I find
[Harmony][] is more graceful and in line with my aesthetic. I spent about half
a day on the migrating.

<!-- more -->

I first forked the repository from [Gayan Virajith][gayanvirajith]'s GitHub.
Then, I made some modification, such as adding Home tab, adding disqus comment,
and change jquery cdn from google to bootstrap. The migrating of blogs is
easier. What I needed to do is just modifying the directory of images.

This blog is a biography of this migration. And, from this blog, I'll start to
write something in English to practice my writing. I'll write as frequently as
I can. The content of the blog will consist of anythings, whatever happened in
my life.
